# What is this repo?

I use this repo for controlling what I am studing in the Computer Architecture field.
Also I am using it to study some x86 Assembly.
:)

## Computer Architecture

To see my progress just go to Issues and/or Projects

## Assembly

Just see the code in the repo.

## How to run the Assembly programs

``` shell
sh compile.sh [asm_file]
```

### Example:

``` shell
sh compile.sh 1_hello_world.asm
```

### To run simply:
``` shell
./1_hello_world
```
